1. javascript, react, quill, axios, node.js, mysql2, bcrypt
2. things to add later / improve on : add crud functionality
3. this is the fourth or fifth attempt at making this app during the craziest week of my life. each time i scrapped everything and restarted which i completely regret lol. but the experience taught me that perfection isn't needed or expected of me and that when i take a moment to breathe and recalibrate myself i can power through tough and stressful situations without buring myself out.

4. songs on repeat to get me through this:
AJUSHI by leellamarz, cruicial star, qm, kim jae wook, nsw yoon, damini
ANTIFRAGILE by le sserafim
LOWLIFE PRINCESS by bibi
MY WAY by justhis, don malik, huh, khan, mackdaddy, los
RUTHLESS by the marias
